Full featured Python library to control the Philips Hue lighting system.

## Features

- Support for Lights
- Support for Groups
- Support for Schedules
- Support for Scenes
- Support for Sensors
- Compatible with Python 2.6.x and upwards
- Compatible with Python 3
- No dependencies
- Simple structure, single phue.py file
- Work in a procedural way or object oriented way

## Installation

### Using distutils

```
sudo easy_install phue
```
or
```
pip install phue
```

### Manually

phue consists of a single file (phue.py) that you can put in your python search path or in site-packages (or dist-packages depending on the platform)
You can also simply run it by putting it in the same directory as you main script file or start a python interpreter in the same directory.
phue works with Python 2.6.x, 2.7.x and 3.x

## Examples

### Pairing on first usage

Hue protocol requires pairing. `phue` stores configuration persistently so you could simply pair with the bridge once interactively before using `phue` in
non-interactive scripts. An easy way to do this would be load the `phue` module interactively passing the bridge IP as a `--host` argument:

```
python3 -m phue --host 192.168.1.42
```

(Replace the IP with the IP of the Hue bridge). This will prompt you to pair with the bridge, and on success `phue` is fully setup.

You could customize persistent storage location if needed `--config-file-path` on the commandline, or `Bridge(..., config_file_path=..)`.

### Basic usage

Using the set_light and get_light methods you can control pretty much all the parameters :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from phue import Bridge

b = Bridge('ip_of_your_bridge')

# If the app is not registered and the button is not pressed, press the button and call connect() (this only needs to be run a single time)
b.connect()

# Get the bridge state (This returns the full dictionary that you can explore)
b.get_api()

# Prints if light 1 is on or not
b.get_light(1, 'on')

# Set brightness of lamp 1 to max
b.set_light(1, 'bri', 254)

# Set brightness of lamp 2 to 50%
b.set_light(2, 'bri', 127)

# Turn lamp 2 on
b.set_light(2,'on', True)

# You can also control multiple lamps by sending a list as lamp_id
b.set_light( [1,2], 'on', True)

# Get the name of a lamp
b.get_light(1, 'name')

# You can also use light names instead of the id
b.get_light('Kitchen')
b.set_light('Kitchen', 'bri', 254)

# Also works with lists
b.set_light(['Bathroom', 'Garage'], 'on', False)

# The set_light method can also take a dictionary as the second argument to do more fancy stuff
# This will turn light 1 on with a transition time of 30 seconds
command =  {'transitiontime' : 300, 'on' : True, 'bri' : 254}
b.set_light(1, command)
```

### Light Objects

If you want to work in a more object-oriented way, there are several ways you can get Light objects.

#### Get a flat list of light objects
```python

lights = b.lights

# Print light names
for l in lights:
    print(l.name)

# Set brightness of each light to 127
for l in lights:
    l.brightness = 127

```

#### Get Light objects as dictionaries

```python
# Get a dictionary with the light id as the key
lights = b.get_light_objects('id')

# Get the name of light 1, set the brightness to 127
lights[1].name
lights[1].brightness = 127

# Get a dictionary with the light name as the key
light_names = b.get_light_objects('name')

# Set the brightness of the bulb named "Kitchen"
light_names["Kitchen"].brightness = 254

# Set lights using name as key
for light in ['Kitchen', 'Bedroom', 'Garage']
    light_names[light].on = True
    light_names[light].hue = 15000
    light_names[light].saturation = 120

# Get a flat list of the light objects (same as calling b.lights)
lights_list = b.get_light_objects('list')

for light in lights_list:
   light.on = True
   light.brightness = 127

```

### Setting Transition Times

In the Hue API, transition times are specified in deciseconds (tenths
of a second). This
is not tracked as a device setting, but rather needs to be applied on
each individual transition command you want to control the time of.

This can be done by specifying a transitiontime keyword when calling
set_light on the bridge:


```python
# Set brightness of lamp 1 to max, rapidly
b.set_light(1, 'bri', 254, transitiontime=1)
```

As a convenience, the Light class implements a wrapper that remembers
a specified transition time for that light, and applies it
automatically to every transition:

```python
light = light_names['Kitchen']
light.transitiontime = 2
# this next transition will happen rapidly
light.brightness = 20    
```

Note that there is a known bug where turning a light off with the
transitiontime specified can cause the brightness level to behave
erratically when the light is turned back on. See [this
discussion](http://www.everyhue.com/vanilla/discussion/204/bug-with-brightness-when-requesting-ontrue-transitiontime5)
This package attempts to work around this issue by automatically
resetting the brightness when necessary, but this may not work in all
cases.

Transition times from 0-300 deciseconds (i.e. 0 - 30 seconds) have
been tested to work.

### Groups

You can also work with the groups functionality of the Bridge. If groups aren't working, try re-setting the bridge by unpluging it and plugging it back again.

```python

# List groups
b.get_group()

# List group 1
b.get_group(1)

# Get name of group 1
b.get_group(1, 'name')

# Get lights in group 1
b.get_group(1,'lights')

# Create a group with lights 1 and 3
b.create_group('Kitchen', [1,3])

# Rename group with id 1
b.set_group(1, 'name', 'New Group Name')

# Change lights within group 1
b.set_group(1, 'lights', [3,4])

# Turn group 1 off
b.set_group(1, 'on', False)

# Delete group 2
b.delete_group(1)

```

### Schedules

You can view, create and delete schedules using the following methods. Note that updates to the Hue API now use local time instead of UTC. If you have issues with schedules not triggering correctly, double check that the time zone is set correctly on your Hue Bridge and that your time in your code is not in UTC by default.

```python

# Get the list of different schedules
b.get_schedule()

# Get the data of a particular schedules
b.get_schedule(1)

# Create a schedule for a light, arguments are name, time, light_id, data (as a dictionary) and optional description
data = {'on': False, 'transitiontime': 600}
b.create_schedule('My schedule', '2012-11-12T22:34:00', 1, data, 'Bedtime' )

# Create a schedule for a group, same as above but with a group_id instead of light_id
data = {'on': False, 'transitiontime': 600}
b.create_group_schedule('My schedule', '2012-11-12T22:34:00', 0, data, 'Bedtime' )

# Delete a schedule
b.delete_schedule(1)

```

## Using phue with Max/MSP via Jython

You can use the phue library within [Max/MSP](http://www.cycling74.com) by using [Nick Rothwell's](http://www.cassiel.com) Jython objects.  He recently updated the version to support Jython 2.7 which is required for phue to work.

Download it here: https://github.com/cassiel/net.loadbang.jython

## Using phue on iOS via Pythonista

You can use phue on your iOS device via the [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista) app.
This is a great way to build quick prototypes on iOS as you don't need to compile anything, you can code directly from the device itself.

See this little example:
